                    <p class="card-text">The Git/Github course on Codecademy not only provided a basic overview of Git/Github but also allowed me to explore the nature and workflow of being a programmer. In Particular, I learned about how Git can be used to keep track of my project's code locally. The course also illustrated how Git could be particularly useful for collaborative purposes through the use of networks and GitHub. One aspect of this module that had the most significant impact on me was the idea of contributing to the GitHub community. GitHub is a site that prospers from a team of developers who work together to solve problems, and creating a well-rounded profile and engaging with the community feels important to my growth. As a student, I will continue to engage with Github to learn from others, as well as work on future projects.

                    <p class="card-text">The Natural Simulations module in Khan Academy demonstrates how computer science is linked to math concepts and how those concepts can be applied to simulate a natural environment. In particular, the module showcases how randomness can be integrated into computer science to achieve accuracy in certain simulations, such as mimicking the terrain of mountains or paint splatter. An aspect of the module that impacted me the most was how I could use different types of randomness to mimic real-world scenarios, such as the project below, which explores a simulation of Algae’s interaction with bacteria. In this project, I incorporated randomness to simulate how the ecosystem occurs to that in real life. Moving forward, I will continue to use these math concepts to further enhance my understanding of computer science, as well as apply that knowledge in applicable scenarios.</p>

The course also highlights other systems such as binary, selection, insertion, merge, and quick sort, as well as asymptotic notation to describe the efficiency of algorithms. This was also the most impactful aspect of this module, as the asymptotic notation used in algorithms can also be applied to ideas outside of programming. Moving forward, I will use these ideas to work through my future learning of computer science along with other aspects of my life.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The ‘Create a Front-End App with React’ course reintroduced me to many past concepts and connected those concepts to build front-end programs with React. Building a front end requires code to be organized more efficiently as a website continues to expand, and I learned how to consider that when writing code in this module. Something from this course that impacted me the most was the introduction to React, and how it provides many resources to build front-end apps. Working with different types of languages always gives me a new perspective on programming. Going forward, I will continue to use clean and organized coding practices and my knowledge of the front end in my future independent projects. </p>

In particular, the modules went other the different types of user data tracking (cookies, geolocation), and also briefly talked about using data to create real-world simulations. However, the aspect that stood out to me the most was the methods of data encryption, where I learned how computers are constantly encrypting and decrypting information to keep the digital world as secure as possible. Moving forward, I will keep this information in mind regarding my own internet safety, so I can continue working with computer science to learn as a student.

Through this course, I primarily learned about SQL, a programming language that focuses on back-end elements, such as manipulating databases and updating, deleting, and retrieving data from outside sources. However, an aspect of this course that impacted me the most was the introduction to Mocha and Chai. These tools are javascript test frameworks that allow me to work through difficult or unexpected errors effectively, which I found to be particularly helpful when programming from multiple files. I will continue to use these features, along with the concept of back-end coding, to further expand my flexibility in programming.</p>

These modules also taught me about the complexity of the internet itself, and how IPs and packets play a role in our lives today. In particular, one aspect of these modules that impacted me the most was the global digital divide and how it plays a role in real-world issues, as internet access across the globe is extremely unbalanced. Moving forward, I have a better idea of how computer science plays a role in our world, which will help me further understand our world and expand my learning.</p>

Not only does it symbolize how algorithms are expressed in computer science, but also other aspects of life. When working on both the course on algorithms and with the cube myself, I learned how to view obstacles from more than one perspective. This is why the most impactful aspect of this module was when I decided to work through the 3x3 cube, where I experienced the mindset of cubing for myself. Along with working on my 3x3 time, I will also continue to see what other barriers I can overcome in the world of cubing.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The hackathon project challenged my group to present a creative solution to a world issue through a website. During this module, we decided to build a city simulation game embedded into a website, so users could interact with the issue themselves to better understand how we can make a change. What stood out the most during this project was building my first back end, as I had no prior experience with this style of programming. Creating a back end posed many challenges, but I was eventually able to understand how it interacts with other parts of the website. This project stands as a team experience that challenged us with not only programming but also to use programming to express ourselves creatively, and inspires me to use programming in creative ways moving forward.</p>

The creative coding challenge also centred around the idea of using object-oriented programming. An aspect of this module that impacted me the most was the refactoring portion of the challenge, as my group and I could finally build a basic version of a ‘backrooms’ game that always interested us. I want to continue learning about 3D rendering in the future as I would love to one day work with games that are as immersive as they are today. This project is a foundation for my future learning of computer science, game development and many other ideas I'm passionate about.</p>
